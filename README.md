# Bug Run Funtime Crossy Game

Welcome to Bug Run Funtime Crossy Game!

## How to play

Use the arrow keys or the 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd' keys on your keyboard to move your LittleGuy around the game board.

The aim of the game is to reach the water. If you bump into any bugs, you'll lose a life and be sent back to the start!

You have three lives in all and once they're gone you lose the game.
